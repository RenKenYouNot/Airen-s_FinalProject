# Airen-s_FinalProject
My final

I want to do a quiz for my final. It may be based on a popular franchise like Harry Potter, Barbie, or Bratz.

Updated Project Idea: I've been working on a sorting hat quiz for my final. It will include multiple questions with 4 answer options for each question. Each answer will correspond to a Hogwarts house and the points will be added up to reveal the players house. 

The results will include:
2 iconic housemembers (I might write a brief bio for each person that's mentioned)
The house founder
The house colors and Emblem
A brief bio of the character traits associated with the house
  
Update on CSS: I'm scrapping the css file idea for right now. It's confusing for me, and I've already been struggling with trying to format my animation. I've been testing out
my code with Visual Studio Code and I've had to run and adjust the animation 7 times already, and I only have the loading screen animation done thus far. 

I'd like to feature some graphics in a css file and that's all i'm positive about at the moment.
